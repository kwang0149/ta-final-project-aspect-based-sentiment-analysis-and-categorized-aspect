but nice hotel for budget traveller .
We moved to this Hotel because its closer to the Double Six Beach .
"The room smelled very musty , it was unclean and dirty ."
"My duvet cover had some brown undefined stains , it looked like fecal ."
"The wifi was appalling , the pool area was completely inadequate , without any loungers or even any space for lounging for that matter ."
"The room had a distinct smell of drains , and was smaller than your average boat cabin ."
"This hotel was clean and had a fantastic price ! Perfect for the solo traveler as the rooms are small , but for the price it can ' t be beat ! The spa was terrific as well ! I would stay there again ! Located close enough to walk to beach and all the shopping and local restaurants ."
Great value .
Great location .
Modern decor .
Major let down is no pool to swim in .
Well the tiny pool is next to the restaurant and not inviting for swimmers or sunbathers .
Spa was AMAZING .
Honestly best massage I had in Bali ! .
Lovely place in great location .
Walking distance to beaches and great restaurants .
In house spa that is a magnificent experience with ginger tea to begin and end massage .
Staff are gorgeous and SO helpful .
I will stay again ! ! ! ! Pool is small but I went to the beach .
The rooms are small but have every thing you need except a fridge which did not bother me .
"Staff are great and helpfull , location 5 min to the beach and eats in both directions ."
i got promo price 199k for one night .
"pros : - they provide tv , safe deposit box - clean room , cozy bed , good aircon - they provide kiblat locator inside the desk and a bible ."
"We stayed 2 weeks , the staff have been more than accommodating , the rooms yes are small ."
"Ani the reception manager is amazing , during our time here we have had need to have a doctor visit , and she went above and beyond ( thank you Ani ) ."
Clean and delicate rooms .
Great bed and linens .
"The rooms are a bit small , but no problem for us ."
Pool area is in the lobby / restaurant and is not that appealing .
Small but good breakfast .
New menu every day .
Good hotel with excellent location for the beach and seminyak .
Breakfast is not worth it and the pool is questionable as a pool .
