The host offered free water bottles, but each time they were pre-opened bottles. The air conditioning was not working properly, room was too hot to sleep.

A 4D3N stay means 96 hours on the property, yet Manager Nurah was insistent that the in-house museum & gallery would not have sufficient interest for a tour. The statement was made mid stay. When I mentioned I would gather sufficient interest, Nurah made things extraordinarily difficult by restricting the timing for all 5 parties to only a 1000-1200hr period on 1 particular day.
Lots of politics within the hotel, many other issues with Nurah & Ketut with the same bullying stance. Do you wanna deal with politics during a vacation?

"A breathtaking jungle setting - unfortunately, one of the few positive things we can say about our experience. The panoramic view room advertisement was misleading, we were greeted by a room containing two double beds and little else. The patio furniture was beautiful, yet uncomfortable. The bathroom was dark, damp and dirty, with tea and coffee amenities situated next to the toilet. We were eager to explore other rooms - the concierge kindly informed us our room was “not the nicest”, and that we could upgrade to a premium room with private pool for an extra $120 AUD per night. We decided to upgrade as the premium room was a drastic improvement, yet the photos attached represent the general lack of cleanliness. We felt the on premises restaurants and bars were overpriced and of poor quality. Overall, the setting was stunning - but the features of the resort left us spending the vast majority of our stay off premises.","[{'aspect': 'panoramic view room advertisement', 'polarity': 'NEG', 'opinion': 'misleading', 'category': 'SERVICE#GENERAL'}, {'aspect': 'room', 'polarity': 'POS', 'opinion': 'not the nicest', 'category': 'ROOM#GENERAL'}, {'aspect': 'bathroom', 'polarity': 'NEG', 'opinion': 'damp', 'category': 'ROOM#BATHROOM'}, {'aspect': 'toilet', 'polarity': 'NEG', 'opinion': 'dirty', 'category': 'ROOM#BATHROOM'}]"

The pool was small but clean. There were no parasols by the loungers. It was hot and there was no shade around the pool.
There were limited choice for breakfast but it was good. The staff weren’t able to cope with simple requests. We ordered American breakfast which comes with eggs of your choice, hash brown and grilled tomatoes . Both days we had to ask for tomatoes and on the 2nd day we were given raw tomatoes which was served after we had finished eating.
The lighting in the rooms is poor. A lick of white paint on the walls is all that’s needed to brighten the rooms. The table provided in the room was tiny . There was no where to put on your laptop if you wanted to work. There were no plug points to  plug the kettle in . Had to disconnect the lamp to have a cuppa.

The location of the hotel was perfect for us. We were looking for a quiet place to stay during our visit to Ubud.
The size of the room we stayed in was impressive. It provided ample space to move around comfortably. The bed and pillows were comfortable.
The hotel's general facilities were quite good. We explored a little bit. Didn't use the poll but it seems amazing.
Our breakfast was fine, with good options and they even attended all the questions we had (one of our group has strong food allergies).

"My husband and I were booked to spend 3 nights here but only stayed one due to some issues that arose.
The cleanliness was very poor. I don't know if they rushed our room since we arrived before check in. Upon arrival they said our room would be ready in half hr. We were happy to leave our bags and wait for check in time but since they said it could be done soon, we decided to wait around. An hr later no one had notified us, so we went to the lobby. The main lobby clerk  jumped on the phone to find out if our room was ready. At this point we felt well looked after and the man who welcomed us was friendly.
Unfortunately, the toilet had a significant pool of vomit or poo (brown substance) splashed around it and tampon wrappers on the floor. It wasn't easily spotted since the floor is pink marble-like. Upon closer inspection, you could see rims left around the sink suggesting these areas had been missed. We actually decided to clean it and not let it ruin our stay. I honestly didn't feel all that trusting that the cleaners could do a good enough job and if I did it myself, at least I knew it was disinfected.
We booked this place because it seemed like a quiet retreat but it was far from it. The views from the infinity pool are beautiful and there's lots of lovely architecture. But we were kept awake by a very bright light coming in through a window above the doorway that had no curtain and could not be turned off. We were also awakened by a cockerel at 4am, which continued all through the morning. We left at 9:30am and it was still going.

"While it is true that some facilities are not fully updated, such as limited charging ports, what Tanah Merah lacks in the shiniest fittings it more than makes up for in its authentic Balinese charm and excellent customer service. In my opinion, if you want to truly experience Bali and still live in comfort and style, you are better off at Tanah Merah, than some clandestine hotel with its cookie cutter design. For one, the view is sublime and the location is right above petanu river and a beautiful waterfall you have direct access to. It is also a short drive from centre city ubud while still being a  private retreat. Secondly, the furnishings and design of the villa has been done with a keen eye for detail. We spent long nights in the open air area on a raised wooden platform with traditional seating, overlooking the rainforest. I can of course only speak of the villa we stayed in and the villas next to us. Breakfast perfectly suited our needs with a range of options to choose from, the staff were very friendly and accommodating to our vegetarian dietary needs. After breakfast in the morning we could find the owner Dr Peter in the lounging in the lobby, definitely take the opportunity to chat with him about the history of the resort- he built it himself and you can tell the effort and care he still puts in it based on the excellent management of the resort.","[{'aspect': 'facilities', 'polarity': 'NEG', 'opinion': 'not fully updated', 'category': 'FACILITY#MAINTAIN'}, {'aspect': 'staff', 'polarity': 'POS', 'opinion': 'friendly', 'category': 'SERVICE#GENERAL'}, {'aspect': 'view', 'polarity': 'POS', 'opinion': 'shiniest fittings', 'category': 'LOCATION#VIEW'}, {'aspect': 'location', 'polarity': 'POS', 'opinion': 'right above petanu river', 'category': 'SERVICE#GENERAL'}, {'aspect': 'balinese charm', 'polarity': 'POS', 'opinion': 'exquisite', 'category': 'SERVICE#GENERAL'}, {'aspect': 'management', 'polarity': 'POS', 'opinion': 'excellent', 'category': 'LOCATION#VIEW'}]"

"In regards to my stay in the hotel, it was one of the worst experiences have ever had. i got tricked by your advertisement that it is 5 star hotel while the property its just a hostel it doesnot deserve any star rating.
Starting from the checkin:
1) I arrived in the night as my flight with the evening there was only one guy at the property.(Security problem, plus nobody to help with the luggage) i had to carry(no trolley ofcourse!) myself 4 bags to the room and through the stairs to reach the so called villa.
2) poor illumination all around. my daughter tripped three times un even stairs!!.
3) No room service!!. i called the number put in their menu it was ringing with no one is picking the phone. i  called the reception and they gave me another number. they said we do not do room service because we are out of staff. thats not a kind of answer to receive form so called 5 star hotel.
4) the room condition-villa it was very poorly maintained. doors not closing properly the mesch installed aroud the opening is rusted and broken i have to close the opening by plastic bag myself.... the water pressure is very poor, all the windows do not close properly another security problem.
5) the breakfast was very poor it is similar to the quality of a hostage. one egg one coffee and old danish not even heated. coffee mostly water and no choices!!.
6) the pool is also poorly maintained during the stay i have never seen a pool guy cleaning the pool or spraying chlorine on it. again its health hazard.
7) whenever i am asking for taxi they are taking advatage of the tourist and charging more. infront of me the family was dropped from the airport and i wanted to go to ubud center they charged 80k IDR while it costs max of 50k IDR.
thats not professionalism from so called 5 star hotel.
i checked out earlier than expected as i couldnot stay in such property. when i asked to refund for last niht they refused as they say its not refundable.

Despite only eating at the restaurant at the hotel and drinking the water from the hotel, my mom still got ‘Bali Belly’ and the property manager was very responsive and arranged to have a doctor come to the hotel within an hour.
The owner has a gallery of his artifacts that he’s collected over the years and it’s quite impressive. The location is quite far from everything. A lot of tour groups that offer pickup from Ubud would not pick up from the hotel and if they did, they would for an extra fee.

"There are 2 restaurants at the property; however, due to the pandemic, they only operate one but have both menus available. The one menu is charged in USD, and is quite expensive. In addition to the expensive prices, there’s a 21% tax and service charge added. We required laundry services during our stay and despite the fees being advertised in rupiah, we were charged in USD, the conversion at the time of check out was not equivalent to the rupiah advertised. The showers have no water pressure at all. The wifi is very slow.
