Friendly staff and good rate considering its location ! ‚òÄ Ô∏è Its a 5 - minute walk going to the beach wherein you can find variety of restaurants .

It was been a great experience .
"I need to say thanks to a girl of the staff , Ani , she helped me in different situations ."
Pros : Bed Pillows Clean Rooms Cons : Noisy Smelling Rooms Taximafia that runs their transportation with double prices to normal .
The room was lovely and clean and everyone was very friendly .
The beach was very close and we used to pool to cool down on an afternoon ! There were cultural activities we were in invited to take part in and the centre of Seminyak wasn ‚Äô t far at all to walk along the beach .
All in all perfect for what we needed it for but rooms were a little small .
Booked this hotel for our last night in Bali .
"My room smelled like moth balls and dank basement - nice ! The room was extremely run down and as others have noticed , this hotel is extremely loud ."
"Found all the staff wonderful , Ayu in the restaurant was extremely caring ."
But the owner was also there ( Sebastian ) he was so arrogant that it was an insult to us .

The room was fantastic n close to the spa ( Denyuh spa ) and the service perfect The breakfast is great .

Great WI Fi .
"Rooms are fine , But very small ."

"Very near to the beach , only 5 - 7 min walk ."
"Leaking pipe , and bathroom ."

Too bad they didn ' t serve breakfast ( I stayed at the much cheaper budget hotel that still provides breakfast ) .
"However , I appreciate their cleanliness , air - conditioned rooms , hot shower and room service ."
If you are looking for a budget hotel with no frills then Grandmas is a good option close to Seminiyak beach .

Its a great place to acclimatise .
This place is ideal if you want to spend the night close to the airport .
The rooms or rather small .
The breakfast is not included .

Hotel itself is not new interms of average .

Service is also quite good .
The problem is a narrow parking place and uncomfortable plus the location is not strategic .
"Located near Ngurah Rai Airport and Kuta Beach , lots of local food around ."
"Cozy room and fluffy pillows , the bathroom are clean , the water pressure is great ."
Too bad some of the ramp are too high for wheelchair .

Love the minimalist design of the hotel .
"Rooms are clean , comfortable ."
Service is friendly .

"Bathrooms are old and dirty , also bed sheets aren ' t clean , also the towels ."
"we used to stay at other hotels in kuta on our last night as the plane always leaves in the early morning , always involving a large taxi fare or to much travalling time to get to airport , we then found the harris hotel , cheap , clean , free shuttle to airport , we stay with them every time we leave or arrive ."

Nice crisp clean air conditioned restaurant but grossly over priced .
* * * * Rooms stink like smoke and cigars .
"This was for an overnight stay in Bali , as reported it is near to the airport so good access to the airport , the hotel reception area gives you a false sense of security a facade behind that is a noisy hotel with small rooms that need some TLC , the bar is poorly stocked and consists of a couple of Chairs and tables at the back of the reception ."

Great location .
The room ( 101 ) was small and had a very weird window to nowhere .

"However , the restaurant food is a bit boring ."

Highly recommend and ask for Agus if you need any help great guy .
"Excellent service with very polite staff , very good restaurant ."
The bar has the best staff that Ive see as well .
If you try the bar ask for the barman called khrisna he will provide the best customer service .

Fan doesn ' t work well .
