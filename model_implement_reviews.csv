It is so calm and quiet. Best place to relax and get a piece of mind.
There is nothing not to like. This place is perfect.
"Location is good, but food is very expensive"
expensive food
"The whole of the resort lived up to its name as it was very artsy. There was a choice of American and Continental breakfast and also had noodles on the menu .The pool was beautiful ,overlooking the natural forests of Ubud. The resorts boasts a museum which is spectacular and the owner was kind enough to give us a full tour and explanations of all his findings."
"The resort is about 10 minutes drive away from city Centre, however a taxi was easily accessible to move around in Ubud."
The property is located In middle of Ubud surrounded by nature. Staff were very helpful + friendly. Good hospitality. Will recommend for those who love nature.
Breakfast included. Quiet location
Too far from shops and activities
Room was cozy and comfortable. Food in  restaurants was amazing and tasty. Staff was friendly and helped out guests in case of special food requests. spa center were very good and comfortable.
Bath salts could be provided for bath tub. Few charging ports
Breakfast was good
Not everything was open only 2 restaurants not 3
couldnt see the art collection.
"Amazing views, relaxing place, out from crowds and unbelievable sunrise and sunsets!"
"Restaurant can be improved, but it‚Äôs just a suggestion."
The room was big enough and very comfortable. The views were amazing from the pool
the gym was like old and with not too much implements to exercise. Also the few implements that were there were rusty.
"The staff were really lovely and helpful, the breakfast was plentiful. You could see in the distance the monkeys playing in the trees."
"The scenery, the relaxed restaurant and the kindness of the people"
The noisy gallery and the shower floaded easily after a shower
Great location and lovely people. The hotel is beautiful.
The room door didn‚Äôt close properly and it was really hard to remove the key after closing it. The bathroom door didn‚Äôt close and the pillows were very uncomfortable.
"The place amenities, the staff, the Cascade, nature, pools,"
"The room was a bit old(doors  and floor made of wood, made noise)
Food menu was limited.
Location was a bit too far from the centre of Ubud."
I liked pool and the amazing view of nature
"So happy for being with friendly staff and even Peter, the founder of the resort. A lovely place with natural surroundings, especially the pretty waterfalls and the running river full of swallows that we cannot see in the west these days. Done shootings on the rooftop at 6am. The rice Terraces are so close. Indeed a beautiful place to stay. Thanks for the beautiful place and staff members. Michael and Jane Moon"
Nothing to complain about any particular things. The pillows are too soft and thin.
"The view was incredible. Our room was in the middle of the jungle.
The staff was kindly"
"I think that is too expensive for what you received.
The breakfast was really poor and not of good quality.
The restaurant is expensive, the full menu is in dollars and they charge you 12 dollars for Balinese food. There are no restaurants nearby, so you need to go to the Ubud. Is a must to have a scooter or a car."
"Fantastic hotel in fantastic place, this is what i expected visited bali!
We didn't spent time there, it was just a starting points for our excursions 
Location! All wanted places very close to it
Amazing views
Super cool swimming pool
Nice breakfast
Super friendly staff
Wild nature(monkeys visited us during breakfast time)"
Very specific room design:)
"The pease off the resort lovely gardens the art AND special the amazing art collection in the galery a must to visit,and the work the owner has done for the people of Bali."
"For us no problem but I can understand that clients say to far from to Ubud,its only a short drive by taxi 100 rpi and you are  in the middle in town  WHERE it is a madhouse thats why we went for out of town resort."
"Beautiful resort, overlooking a jungle valley. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The staff is very accommodating and friendly! I loved how close the place is to Ubud but at the same time without the hecticness of Ubud center."
"The place could use a little touch-up. What they‚Äôve done with the rooms (not the theme but more the use of the space available) could be better. Also, the breakfast is poor and in general the restaurant could be better"
"ƒÆ have appreciated the refinte style, which made the villa a true open air museum"
"Our location was to close to a field populated by many rusters that have waken us up multiple times. The personels was friendly, but a bit elusive to our requests"
Beautiful location and great staff.
Water pressure was very low. Lots of step‚Äôs everywhere wouldn‚Äôt suit some people.
Purposely returned to see the incredible collection of art and antiquities which did not disappoint. The pool was lovely and the breakfast very good.
"Our cabin was difficult for 2 septuagenarians with very step rickety steps down into the bathroom. The gardens although lovely, needed tidying, maintaining and weeding. It was quite isolated to eat out and the restaurant expensive."
The views Where fab
Too far out of the city
"Loved the view, the peace and quiet, and the helpfulness of the staff. Room cleaned every day. Beatiful Balinese chalets."
"Peter, Noorah and their entire team were attentive, helpful and so very kind.
Massage, restaurant and pool were all top notch. It‚Äôs on the outskirts of Ubud center, but so worth it. 
Not all rooms overlook the ravine/river, so choose a Deluxe suite or villa for maximum enjoyment.
Would love to go back and revisit Peter‚Äôs treasure trove of art!!
The rooms were immaculately clean and have. Dry comfortable beds and pilloww.
A true treasure."
It was all amazing
"Very friendly service, and very well organised resort. The surrounding countryside was exactly as I had expected but the distance from the main town, Ubud remind, was not (expected)."
"Nice ,very quite. Village vibes."
Location is bit far from city centre. And no good shop around. Restaurant is basic.
"I loved this hotel, the location, rooms and staff were perfect and by far my favourite place to stay"
If they could have added some chairs on our balcony that would have topped it off
a bit further away from centre
Great staff they made ure everything was perfect and gave us a tour of the full facility.
Our room was massive and had plenty of space for bags etc. Bathroom was very clean and so was the whole resort area. Great location for taxis and lovely and quiet area of Ubud. Two swimming pools which were both clean and perfect views.
We had a fan and aircon which was great becuase the aircon could have been more powerful. This did not upset our stay whatsoever as the grounds were amazing.
A waterfall is literally right on the property as well as a river that‚Äôs a short hike. The views and grounds are beautiful. The staff are amazing and arranged scooter rentals for our family to drive into Ubud and visit the Rice Terraces. Good value for the money. The included breakfast is also nice with the best views.  1 restaurant located on the property.
"I‚Äôm not sure about the cleanliness of the 2 pools on the property so we didn‚Äôt get in, but the views from the pools are incredible."
"the owner was amazing, he is very friendly, kind and helpful. he helped us to talk to our Crab driver to guide him to come to the right address to pick us up, he was so kind to let us enter to his family temple, he and his wife kindly dressed up with appropriate clothes to enter the temple. the hotel is so peaceful and calm very nice place to relax and enjoy the beauty of nature. we highly recommend this beautiful place. thank you so much to the owner and his family for the help and kindness, if we come back to Bali we will definitely staying here againüôèüôÇ"
the doors are a bit hard to open and close but with patience it gets done .
"the view and decorations are amazing.
stuff is welcoming and friendly.
place is natural made white noise."
"the hotel stuff, little mistake made me an unpleasant morning. Only 10 people for breakfast and stuff could  forget what I have ordered. So I was waiting for 30 minutes until I checked."
"private pool , room size , service and staff , location , beds"
"Limited breakfast options , remote location , far from the airport and other amenities"
No coffee machine üò≠
The few of the location amazing
The nice museum and the owner Mr. Peter
The surroundings were absolutely stunning. The art resort is not within walking distance to the city center and but the jungle view are more than worth it. The staff was incredibly tentative and friendly.
"The property, rooms, and pool are a bit dated and in need of renovation."
Restaurant quality is not matching the resort. The Pizza is definittely not a Pizza (even if I have asked before to make sure ... but no ;) Also the menu is given in $ and in IDR - the price difference for the same item is sometimes multiplied by 4 which absolutelly needs to change.
"The service was great, as we arrived we rented a scooter and it arrived in 20-40 minutes. The owner, Peter, has great PR skills and is to be expected, being in Bali for over 50 years. The rooms are huge, really huge, cleaning them every day. The big pool was really nice, in my opinion it could use a couple of lights in that area or some lights in the pool, after a long day trek in Ubud area it's nice a swim, however it's really dark there. Definitely a must try resort."
"The WiFi was hit or miss, there were times that we couldn't connect or the speeds were slow, and in the breakfast area you didn't catch a signal . The pool could use some reconditioning, there's some moss and some of the kit came out, don't get me wrong, we stayed in the pool more than 6 hours in our last day, it's really great."

"Nice view , it was clean in the room."
"The internet connection was really poor 
All the time i had strange feeling ,couldn't sleep at all ,though we had comfortable bed.I've found that place creepy and maybe haunted"
the view of the jungle was breathtaking. staff was very friendly. Breakfast menu had several options.
I booked a room. should have booked a villa!  do yourself a favor and splurge on a villa
Great location with beautiful views and really friendly and helpful staff
Food (lunch and dinner) could be a bit better and portions a bit bigger. Wifi could be better too.
Nice view in the jungle!The hotel is so authentic and art!
"The pool was not so clean,the location is far away from everything!Very bad wi-fi"
"clean, tidy and a beautiful place to stay"
"beautiful location, splendid art gallery and attentive staff"
"mediocre choice  of food, due to very few guests.breakfast however is good"
I liked the place for a couple days but it was too far out n nothing much to do
"The place was far too quiet , nothing to do after 5pm"
Restaurante prices very expensive
"perfect place perfect staff , helpful , amazing views"
bed sheets and covers cleanliness
the terrace in my villa was spacious
"pillows, bathroom accessories"
"Pools are useless, they are so dirty that even animals don‚Äôt drink from them. Rooms are dirty, smells very bad. Their facilities like bar prices are soo high and the places again are dirty and very weird. The gym is ‚Ä¶ 2x2 square meters with 2 dumbbells with rust.
Surprise there is no welcome drink.. every other place has.
No idea how this hotel has 5 stars, it should have max 2."
Lovely staff and beautiful in nature and waterfall location - the art was lovely  and nice size room
Wifi kept cutting off upstairs
Staff was kind and helpful
The Hotel is really far away. Only cold water in the shower. Maybe this place has been 5 star hotel 20 years ago but not anymore.
Those who like the Art Resort concept may like this property.  Enough Parking Space.
"Main door has peep holes, worn out towels, limited breakfast, Keys are not working. AC not cooling enough because of large room and split AC."
"The accommodation did not meet our expectations.  The hotel was marketed to me as a 5-star hotel, but in reality the accommodation was more like a hostel.  Private villas are certainly better than just a room, but still. We didn't get warm water from the shower on two nights. The host offered free water bottles, but each time they were pre-opened bottles. The air conditioning was not working properly, room was too hot to sleep. We were always required to leave the room key at the reception if we left the hotel (this is a nice idea, but the keys were available to anyone in the open space.) We decided to go somewhere else to spend our vacation. Although we informed the Tanah Merah host about all the problems but they saw no problem at all and did not refund anything for the remaining nights.. In summary, I could say that the place had a lot of flaws to be 5-star level and basic things have not been fixed, for example lighting and broken tiles in the swimming pool etc."
Breakfast was set menu. Could have been better if it is Buffet
the staff were laovely and the view was stunning
"The rooms were not 5 star, not even close, very old and run down and unclean, the rooms smelt"
"Amazing views from the villa, inside was beautifully architectural, food was fantastic and the staff were so helpful and friendly during our stay"
Nothing everything was amazing
"Like the name suggests, the place as indeed very artsy. there was a huge gallery that also served as a restaurant that had just opened, very beautiful. 
Our room itself was so aesthetically pleasing, ,so warm & vibrant. our pool was on the edge, overlooking the forest. absolutely beautiful. 
Staffs were extremely engaging & helpful."
"Everything was great, food was on point every time üëç"
A beautiful peaceful place with the friendliest and most accommodating staff
Hot water took long to come out of the taps
The swimming pools and the staff
"This is certainly not a 5-star hotel but more akin to a 1-star, the bathroom smelled bad, too noisy (we were all in neighboring rooms), poorly maintained with aging decoration in the room."
The best thing is the view. The tropical forest and roaring of river in the canyon are great.
"The villa was not in the best condition: some lights were not working, plugs and switchers were situated in not very convenient places. It was quite dark in the room."
The traditional Balinese architecture
A little bit run down
"The gardens were stunning and the staff were incredibly personable, accommodating and friendly. The air conditioning unit suffered a malfunction whilst I was there which can't be helped but the response time in getting it fixed was extraordinary having taken it down whilst I was out and repaired it in a matter of hours. This is testament to the efforts of the people there to make this place a great stay. Thank you SO much to the staff at the resort, they really made the experience for me."
There were very few plug sockets in my room which caused an issue and one of the extension sockets actually sparks if moved which was slightly alarming but caused me no further issues once placed carefully. Would be nice to have lights in the pools too so they can be better used at night!
"Unique and pleasant location , quiet and sound of the river is soothing , all staff are friendly and helpful"
"Excellent location, beautiful ambience , freindly and helpful hotel team, do their best to keep you comfortable and happy."
"No lift to go to room, poor wifi,  found live cockroach in bedsheets on 1st night , day after next again insect bite in bed with blood from the bite on the sheets couldn't find the insect but from the two point bite could be a spider , ruled out snake. Check under your sheets before sleeping, it's in a forest area."
"Great location just outside the madness that is Ubud but within easy access.  Comfortable and clean rooms, lovely staff and a beautiful bonus waterfall. Food in the sky bar was really nice.  Lots of interesting art to see. A choice of pool was unexpected."
"Location was beautiful, as were the facilities. Staff were amazing, they even gave us a complimentary room upgrade, to an amazing big room with a gorgeous view and private pool!"
Will return for longer stay next time
"The one great thing about the property? The view of the jungle, which you can get from other neighbouring properties."
"I agree with other reviewers that said the great reviews must have been bought...
A 4D3N stay means 96 hours on the property, yet Manager Nurah was insistent that the in-house museum & gallery would not have sufficient interest for a tour. The statement was made mid stay. When I mentioned I would gather sufficient interest, Nurah made things extraordinarily difficult by restricting the timing for all 5 parties to only a 1000-1200hr period on 1 particular day.
Lots of politics within the hotel, many other issues with Nurah & Ketut with the same bullying stance. Do you wanna deal with politics during a vacation?
Plenty of loose tiles, dangerous for anyone walking around barefoot. Filthy bed causing itches nightly. Remaining amenities are usable, but not passable."
"I absolutely love this hotel. I‚Äôve travelled to 45 countries and stayed in loads of hotels. This is my favourite place in the world. I‚Äôve been twice this year and I‚Äôll definitely be back. It‚Äôs peaceful, beautiful and has a magical atmosphere. It‚Äôs a perfect place to just chill. But equally there are plenty of things to do in the area if you want to get out and about."
A shuttle into town and back would be good. I read in reviews on Tripadvisor that they did this. But when I asked them they didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. 
It‚Äôs easy and cheap to get a taxi into the centre of Ubud but I found it hard to find a taxi to get back I only found one taxi rank where they totally overcharged me.
Authentic Ubud resort experience. Beautiful sun rises and sunsets viewed from hotel. Staff so helpful and accommodating.
it‚Äôs uniqueness and art and artefacts as well as all the amenities such as the restaurant and landscaping
"I enjoyed the little cottage I stayed in (the porch was great for relaxing) and spent time at one of the two pools while watching the sunset. The location of the dining room and pool, in relation to my accommodation, was convenient and easy."
"There was a lot of noise in the morning as the staff was gathering for the day. Due to the style of the little cottage I was in, noise carried very easily. Loud talking/laughing, and moving of gardening equipment were easily heard at 7:00 a.m. The light near the bed did not work and there was only one outlet for charging my electronics. The art museum attached to the resort was a huge draw for me, yet I found out it was only open once a month and for large groups, so it was not possible for me to see it. The rooftop was not finished and was under construction. There was not a lot of information within the room about the resort, which left me with little options other than to go back down to Ubud."
everything was good
Amazing location with beautiful views from the pool
"Unhygienic place, bathroom smelled terrible. Seemed like never cleaned/maintained for months."
Visually stunning! Everywhere you look there was something interesting and artistic to look at. We loved the waterfall that you could walk down to. The food at the restaurant was amazing and we were impressed by the friendly and super helpful service of the staff. There are TWO gorgeous pools with incredible views of the rainforest.
"It was a good resort with Infinity Pool and view. Rooms and bathroom were clean and big in size. So overall, worth the money."
Breakfast options were less.
"Everything !!! The team and Management was Amaysing Funny and friendly with lot of advises..the propriety was beautiful with  a great pool !! What a feeling !!! Really enjoy the Arts around with Really good service and restauration/breakfast‚Ä¶also the property is close to ubud center, we will definitely go back‚Ä¶üôèüëç"
Please don‚Äôt go to the waterfall with your tongues !! Very sleepy !!!"
I enjoyed the authentic experience of the Timor Cottage altho it might not be everyone‚Äôs preference as the steps to the bathroom needed to be negotiated attentively. Loved the carvings in the doors and wardrobes. Would stay there again if I could be sure to view art collection. Also would have liked more time to do the walk to the river and waterfall. Staff were so very helpful when I needed to access medical clinic and I am deeply grateful.
Access to view art collection was not possible on this visit
"Nature and fresh air, clean very spacious room , good for meditation"
Far from food stall
"Timor cottage was absolutely beautiful and very comfortable. AC worked well, bathroom was great and clean. Staff were very friendly and helpful, we used the laundry service and it was very quick and good service. Swimming pool was great and we hiked to the waterfall one morning. The area was up a bit of a hill but taxi drivers didn‚Äôt mind picking up from there. The surrounding village and rice paddies were stunning."
The entire property was very quiet during our stay (this could have been seasonal) with not many other guests. The same went for the on site restaurants. The sky bar closed at 9pm which was a shame! The spa was open by appointment for massages - this was a little unclear.
I liked the garden and the property was clean. The view was also nice. I can recommend this to someone else to stay here :)
It‚Äôs depends. If you are a family the location not the best because too far from everything by walking. Otherwise you should rent a car or a driver. If you are a couple definitely need a motorcycle which is normal.
"The rooms, the whole property, the staf"
Bit far from town
The location and property is very beautiful.
"We were not notified prior to arrival that several facilities (main restaurant, cafe, bar were closed for either renovation or no reason at all. Disappointing as I think it would be an amazing place to stay with everything operational."
"I thoroughly enjoyed the tranquility of the area which greatly contributed to a relaxing experience. It felt like Boeing in m middel of the forrest. The pool was lovely, and the cabin impressed me with its spacious layout, including its own private location nesr the pool. The overall appearance of the hotel was also very appealing. Additionally, the surroundings of the hotel were quite pleasant."
"I found the restaurant's food and beverage pricing to be quite high. Given the quality and service, it might be worthwhile to reassess your pricing strategy. The breakfast was adequate at first, but I noticed a lack of variety over several days. Adding more options could greatly improve the morning experience for guests. Although there were many mosquitoes in the cabin, the staff did provide covers and mosquito coils, which helped. However, making the cabins less open could further prevent mosquitoes from entering so easily. Regarding the location, although it was a bit far from the center, traveling by scooter was convenient and the route was scenic, enhancing the overall experience."
Clean and calm  . Friendly stuff
The breakfast was not okay no many foods to choose
Place didn't feel inviting. Place is too dark at night with very few lights. Water pressure in the bathroom was bad with no hot water in our room.
"It is an iconic location out from Ubud, facing a forest at the heart of the local community. Local home-front shops provide stuff for a bare living‚Äîa loving community surrounded by many paddy fields.
Tropical weather unveiled the beauty of the forest, river, and the fall.
Got to be in one of the villas."
A handrail on the stairs to the waterfall would open the walk for all ages.
Pools were nice and the houses were cute and cozy
The breakfast was a bit limited. you had a few menu options and they were not able to add things for your diet.
"Very beautiful resort like hotel. Different restaurants, pools, own waterfall and river. Very kind and helpful personnel."
The airconditioning and fridge are a bit loud. And we had no warm water. For a hotel of this level I would have liked to see this better. It was not a major problem for us.
Needs an elevator. Room 8 is up 40 steps
"Clean place, very polite and nice staff"
Good value for money
Restaurant for lunch/dinner had great food. Fantastic views of the canopy. Staff friendly and helpful.
Dated decor and finishings
Lovely friendly staff and a beautiful location in the hills surrounded by forests.
"It was a bit further away from the centre of town than we thought but only a short taxi ride, less than 10 minutes."
Unique concept and amazing views and location
Very inflexible rules and management and staff not so warm compared to other experiences in Bali. Food was quite average and small portion size. Mains served in entree plates and nothing special about the food offered.
The waterfall (accessible from inside the resort).
The view for breakfast.
The view of the big swimming pool.
Nestled in a peaceful village with beautiful traditional houses.
"Night vibes at the resort are a bit gloomy ‚Äì those yellow dim lights, abstract painting (hung inside the room) and the  yellow hue of the room wall give off some spooky feels. 
The restaurant menu: not many choices, not too tasty, and a bit on the pricey side compared to other spots in Ubud town.
The pool had cigarette butts and some unknow things inside the pool (though the staff cleaned them up after I showed them, but the cleanliness game wasn't really on point."
"DONT DOUBT!! BOOK THIS RESORT!
Its so beautiful! The staff are chef kiss! I enjoyed it so much i booked another night on my last day! 10 stars for this hotel!"
We went there on our honeymoon and the room was decorated lovely but that's where it ended.
The views were great and the big pool area was nice
The views were great and the big pool area was nice the little pool was murkey waker.
The food well was cold and chicken was deep fried to a dryness and not what we ordered.
They had cocktails on their menu but no staff to make so the bar was limited but the sky bar was closed.
reasons were covid but not good enough.
The water did not work and we were told oh its a small tank but NO water came out and if you ran around the shower when it did work you might catch a few drops
"Cleaning (smell of the room, dirty pool)"
"Fantastic pool, breakfast and location - great friendly service"
"Everything about the property was amazing! Book it, you will NOT be disappointed"
"Location, staff"
"Dated, not worth the high price, restaurant was average and no atmosphere. Could only buy beer and cheap wine at extortionate prices."
Fantastic location
nothing
"-it‚Äôs not Ubud
- nothing match their description
-left 1 day before because I couldn‚Äôt stand the poor cleanness of the place.
-they keep the tea pot , tea bags without cover in the bathroom top ( not hygiene at all)
-no hot water
-no wifi at all
-breakfast is disgusting, old and poor quality
-no spa service
-no shuttle to the city
-no safe for solo traveler"
"Its not 5 star, more like 2-3 star, photos not as per booking.com, hotel is very ran down and not maintained, location is not ubud but 15 mins drive and $5usd taxi each way, breakfast is horrible, not as per reviews, security concerns where if you leave room, need to hang keys outside managers office, we paid for 4 nights but after numerous complaints to booking.com and hotel, no consideration given so we had to leave 2 nights early and move to another hotel , hence lost 2 nights paid fee. The villa has gaps in doors and windows allowing bugs and mosquitoes since its in bushy area, the second floors have 40 stairs with no lifts, hot water comes after 15 mins of tap running, first night the room phone, internet and air condition didn‚Äôt work even after numerous complaints, the hotel couldn‚Äôt fix it, the hotel has numerous steep stairs outside by pools and other areas with no railings, not safe.
Our holiday was horrible at this hotel and booking.com and hotel denied our complaints and did not consider refund so we left early and lost 2 nights paid accommodation, i have told my family and friends and social media not to come at this hotel and not to use booking.com"
"Staff are confusing and hard to communicate. Breakfast is ok, restaurant is way overpriced also in USD."
"Comfortable bed, always clean, kind staff, amazing view"
"Breakfast wasn‚Äôt full filling, very small portions for all meals, prices were based on USD which was unexpected,"
The rooms were very good and the ambiance is also decent and cleanly maintained.
"The price for the stay was on the higher margin, and they are charging exceptionally high for the food."
"Spacious and luxurious rooms
Stunning view
Excellent service from the staff
Delicious breakfast buffet
Beautiful gardens and pool area
Staff: The staff were absolutely amazing. They were friendly, helpful, and always went out of their way to make sure we had a great stay.
Owner: The owner was also very kind and attentive. He took the time to introduce himself to us and ask us how our stay was going. He also gave us some great recommendations for places to visit in Ubud.
Breakfast: The breakfast was absolutely delicious. There was a wide variety of food to choose from, including Indonesian, Western, and Asian dishes.
Overall, I had an absolutely amazing stay! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in Ubud."
"Fantastic location, awesome arts, spectacular views."
Food prices marked in USD and I would say seriously overpriced per Bali standards. Breakfast could do with a bit better portions.
Clean facilities and lovely staff.
I felt the room was a bit dated but for just one night it was fine.
super location on the hill facing thick forests and waterfall. natural beauty. friendly staff. our villa. the villa no 2.
breakfast should have  be served as buffet
"Nice, big, clean and comfortable rooms. Private waterfall in walking distance. Not far from Ubud central and monkey forest. Staff pleasant and helpful. Monkeys in view in the trees from dusk. Cooking class near by."
"The acoustics of the rooms. We had people staying above us and sounded like they were moving furniture around into the early hours. One night it was until 1am so hard to get to sleep!
Didn‚Äôt understand the concept of having two menus, one in rupiah and one in dollars."
View and room size
"Limited options in food Menu
Limited breakfast"
"The place is in the middle of the jungle. It is peaceful and visually beautiful. Plus, you have an art gallery inside the resort. The staff are really friendly and helpful. They make you feel welcome and try to assist you as best as they can."
It's a little bit secluded. But it makes sense since it's in the middle of the jungle.
Beautiful outlook and staff were very friendly
It wasn't easy to get in Ubud from the Hotel as traffic was always crazy and the Hotel is outside of Ubud.
"very friendly staff, clean, organize"
Very friendly and helpful staff.
Very bad internet connection. Food (breakfast) was not great.
The nature next to the hotel was very nice and the resort provided u with a rental scooter.
"De airconditioning made a lot of noice and the last day it leaked a lot of water all over our clothes. Everything was dripping wet when we came back and it was already late in the evening. There was only one man at the lobby that couldn't speak english good and didn't provide any service. We had to get up at 6 am the next morning for our tour, but instead of sleeping we soend the whole night washing and drying our clothes ourselve. And the hotel didn't even bother telling us that they were sorry or any compensation for the clothes that wete ruined. In my opinion not a 5 star resort and wouldn't come back"
don‚Äôt stay here it‚Äôs not comfortable
"-if you take free breakfast with room‚Ä¶but when you eat breakfast they will take charges‚Ä¶i also paid after free breakfast
-also they don‚Äôt give you toothpaste only in this property in bali‚Ä¶I already stay in whole bali from last 10 days in different hotels all they give tooth paste and free breakfast if your breakfast included but they didn‚Äôt give you
-swimming pool also lots of insects so you can‚Äôt swim here
i am here for 3 days in this property‚Ä¶very bad experience"
Beautiful location but too far from everything
"Booked 2 studios with bath, got basic rooms, no bath, no wifi"
Authentic and sharming hotel. You feel like home. Highly recommended üôèüèº
"The best hotel for this money.  Very quiet, ideal for recovery.  Delicious food, clean room.  I'll come back."
The lock in my room did not work well and the door was hard to close.  It might be a problem for women.
"Amazing location. If you wanna be close to nature, this place is definitely a must visit.  Near the hotel is located waterfall it just a breathtaking place.
Rooms are big, and according to the ""Indonesian standards,"" it is very clean. Hotel staff are open, and always happy to help."
Long waiting time for hot water.
A nice place and good breakfast
"The Property is located away from the rush of Ubud. Next to tropical lush forest with a gorge running behind. Very peaceful place. BUT the most interesting aspect is the whole property is an art museum with the property itself an art. I would recommend everyone to explore it and read up on Jungle Dentist / Dr. Peter Bloch.
All the staffs are excellent and the resort manager, Mr Nura is the best. We loved most of the experience including home made ice cream cones."
Would be more eco friendly to have a jet wash to clean your butt. Pool could be cleaner. Extremely slow internet.
"The property itself is lovley, in a lovley quiet area with no noise at all, the staff are unbelievably friendly, the fully English speaking owner is amazing along with all of his staff, each time you arrive they remember your name and hand you your key which is a very nice gesture. there is a private waterfall with unbelievable views of the jungle this was an unbelievable experience (worth coming just for this) the pools are lovley and it is not too far from the city centre. i love it and would come back"
"the shower was a little cold, maybe just mine"
"I just like everything about the property, the scenic location , the villas nestled in the forest with a mesmerizing water fall down right below the property which is like a 7 mins walk.
I had plans to go out after i check in  but I was so mesmerized by the location of this property that I actually cancelled my plans and stayed at the property whole day.
Monkey forest was a 10 mins ride from property.
Kintami look out was a 35 mins ride
Ayung river rafting was also with 25 mins distance
Bali swing was alao within 30 mins
Tegalalnanf rice fields and Tegenananum waterfall was also not very far
Loved my time at Tannah Merah Art Resort.
The owner Peter and Manager Ngurah were so nice and welcoming. They were very accommodating and also arrange a scooter for me at a very short notice."
A little on the inside and away from centerpoint   but easy access on bike or car in
"Nice getaway from the 'rat race' (Ubud). Staff was very accommodating. Cooked a special soup that's not on the menu. If you wake up early enough, the monkeys come around to entertain. Nice view from the rooftop. We also enjoyed the guided tour of the gallery. Thanks to Peter and his staff!"
The photos don't do the resort justice - it's far bigger and has better views than the photos can capture. It's on a cliffside where you can hear the calming river and see the beautiful lush green forest.
"Most would say it's a bit far from the city, but it's perfect for those that want some quiet AWAY from the city! Apart from that, it's an older establishment; however, has been maintained well."
Breakfast was good
"The aggressive art works in the room and corridors were disturbing and creepy.
It didn‚Äôt have a hospitable feel. The staff were tense and seemed to have been trained to monitor and follow guests rather than make us feel welcome.
Meals at the two restaurants were charged in US dollars, which was unusual and seemed like a money grab."
"Location in the hills, very beautiful."
"A breathtaking jungle setting - unfortunately, one of the few positive things we can say about our experience. The panoramic view room advertisement was misleading, we were greeted by a room containing two double beds and little else. The patio furniture was beautiful, yet uncomfortable. The bathroom was dark, damp and dirty, with tea and coffee amenities situated next to the toilet. We were eager to explore other rooms - the concierge kindly informed us our room was ‚Äúnot the nicest‚Äù, and that we could upgrade to a premium room with private pool for an extra $120 AUD per night. We decided to upgrade as the premium room was a drastic improvement, yet the photos attached represent the general lack of cleanliness. We felt the on premises restaurants and bars were overpriced and of poor quality. Overall, the setting was stunning - but the features of the resort left us spending the vast majority of our stay off premises."
"The whole property needs to be upgraded. We booked a standard room but after inspection we upgraded to a Villa .
The pool was small but clean. There were no parasols by the loungers. It was hot and there was no shade around the pool.
There were limited choice for breakfast but it was good. The staff weren‚Äôt able to cope with simple requests. We ordered American breakfast which comes with eggs of your choice, hash brown and grilled tomatoes . Both days we had to ask for tomatoes and on the 2nd day we were given raw tomatoes which was served after we had finished eating.
The lighting in the rooms is poor. A lick of white paint on the walls is all that‚Äôs needed to brighten the rooms. The table provided in the room was tiny . There was no where to put on your laptop if you wanted to work. There were no plug points to  plug the kettle in . Had to disconnect the lamp to have a cuppa.
The Mesh on the windows is all broken and lets the mosquitos in.
We had so many ants behind our bed and had to ask the staff to spray the room to get rid of them."
"everything is so old and cheap not what we expected for this money.
breakfast menu is not changing and not we was expecting too"
"the grounds are beautiful, gorgeous views and access to a local waterfall. has a lot of potential to be a great place."
"upon arrival bathroom didn‚Äôt look like it had been cleaned. bathtub also didn‚Äôt work. the pools were just ok - the smaller one seemed clean but the big pool was very green, so we didn‚Äôt use it. Wi-Fi was HORRENDOUS. we got kicked off every few minutes, had no access by the pools so ended up leaving a day early as we couldn‚Äôt get anything done."
"No way is this a 5 star hotel. 2 star max
Poor quality rooms with thin walls
Noisy Creepy Jungle
Overpriced restaurant
Gecko poo on my floor 4 times
Curtains don‚Äôt keep light out
Need get taxi to / from Ubud
Too many steps. Not safe"
The location and road to the hotel are nice
"Hotel looks quite old, the common areas were not very clean and the pool was dirty. Generally all the territory is not well taken care of. I would say that puctures at booking.com are much nicer than the place in reality.
The room was not so clean as well, overviewing some technical building. Room service menu is in USD for some reason and obviously way overpriced for this level of service."
Interesting artwork & the environment was beautiful!
"Very tired and worn in the resort overall
Worst breakfast we have experienced in Bali!
Everything in US dollars ( expensive)
A long way from anywhere so costs extra to go into Ubud
Not true to advertising ( e.g. Sky bar was defunct)
Weird ' Hotel California' vibe"
The owner behavior   he gave me proper introduction about there resort  what and where we can find the best things in ubud
I believe it's a resort in jungle so bit silent in the nulight time
"great location, view and lovely staff"
overall the property was clean but the bathroom and toilet facility could be better as The bathroom had a funny odour.
"Surrounding nature
Big room"
"Very bad WiFi
Electricity disconnected more than 3 times on the same day
Breakfast is very limited and poor
Bed is not comfortable
Very old facilities
Kettle takes a long time to boil
Toilet is very old"
We loved the location and friendly staff
"The hotel was not 5 star. 3 stars is a better rating for this hotel. Restaurant food was average. No bartender so a Bacardi cola was not possible. Winelist was very limited, with just 2 wines. The room was a good 3-star due to the size and we overlooked the forest. We didn't stay in the villas, perhaps these were 5-star."
The location was quite secluded from the rest of ubud and thus more quiet and relaxed!
"Some buildings of the property didn‚Äôt fit the overall aesthetic of the old building. The rooms are underwhelming and give of a hostel vibe. The rooms were not cleaned properly and one of the two pools was not usable, the other was a bit dirty. Our biggest problem with the resort was the fact that we were offered a 1l bottle of complimentary water a day, after two days of horrible diarrhoea we noticed that the waterbottle are not sealed, overfilled and standing in the bathroom next to the sink. We have strong suspicion that they got refilled with tap water from the bathroom sink!
The prices from the restaurant are absolutely ridiculous and take advantage from the fact that all other restaurants are a bit far away but it‚Äôs still cheaper to order full dinner for 2 people from grab than to eat a single meal in the hotel restaurant!"
"The resort is in a tranquil and beautiful location.  The 2 pools both have a great view and sitting areas were very relaxing.  Breakfast, lunch and dinners were all good with fresh food and nice serving.  Staff was wonderful and bent over backward.  We missed the tour of the galleries but heard it was amazing!"
"The facilities obviously need a bit more TLC but understandable due to CoVID shut down.  And, we wish the Sky Bar and other bar had been open."
"Clean, friendly staff, good food"
"If you don‚Äôt have a motorbike or a personal driver, it‚Äôs quite far from Ubud center. No way to come dizzy from Ubud during the night by foot."
"Breakfest 3 options to choose from, quite good but make sure bacon is not 3 days old.
2 pools, quiet, great views, relaxing place, big rooms.
Food average, vegetarian soup exellent with bread.
Good service, they bring everything to your room or pool area.
Path down to river was very nice.
Even wild monkeys visited us in pool area, that was nice :)"
"Location is remote, thou we knew this. Taxi is cheap but can take hour to center ubud.
Ubud center and sidewalks are terrible condition, nothing to do with Tanah Mera hotel i know.
Cleaners dont visit rooms, specially when informed that no cleaning needed.
Nothing missing but still littlebit annoying."
"I‚Äôm like breakfast, hotel very quiet , clean . I love it üòç"
Location and view
"The resort is old.. needs renovation, fresh paint and pools need new cares.
The shower pressure was an abomination. You cant shampoo your hair properly."
"-daily yummy breakfast with the most spectacular, unreal view of the jungle
-the staff were the most friendly, personable people who take you in like family. So many sweet younger kids doing a summer job as well and everyone so friendly and willing to stop and chat or help with anything. Very good, warm people
-can't say enough about the view, relaxing nature, and interesting landscape with statues
-can hike down to a private waterfall"
"-really difficult to set up a time to get to see the historic Indonesian artifacts in their museums. In the end, only got to see half of one and I think they have 3 museums. You have to tell the manager far in advance which was saddening since didn't get to do it"
Views with an amazing swimming pool and spa and a very good affordable restaurant. That is a plus as it is opened from 7am to 10pm
The bed weren't very comfy because they were two single mattresses together instead of a big one. You could feel the gap between the two mattresses.
It‚Äôs location was stunning !and very very quite
Cleanliness and service in the room
"The place is beautiful and the owner has tried to make the place an art gallery which is very nice and is the way they sell the hotel (""Art Resort""), but unfortunately when we booked the hotel nobody told us that the art galleries were closed down so it was not possible to see the art at all. The restaurant had only half of the products they offered in the menu and the bar was also closed down. Swimming pool was nice but also need a bit of love, there was no any sunshade so it was quite difficult to enjoy the swimming pool. Rooms looked a bit old."
Art galleries closed down. Bar closed down. Restaurant had only a few options to choose from.
"A Pleasant Stay with Minor Room Issue
I recently had the pleasure of staying at Tanah Meraj art resort, and overall, it was a delightful experience. From the moment we arrived, the staff's warm hospitality made us feel welcomed and cared for. They were attentive, courteous, and always ready to assist with any queries we had during our stay. Kudos to the excellent staff who made our visit so memorable!
The location of the hotel was perfect for us. We were looking for a quiet place to stay during our visit to Ubud.
The size of the room we stayed in was impressive. It provided ample space to move around comfortably. The bed and pillows were comfortable.
The hotel's general facilities were quite good. We explored a little bit. Didn't use the poll but it seems amazing.
Our breakfast was fine, with good options and they even attended all the questions we had (one of our group has strong food allergies).
In conclusion, I highly recommend the stay for anyone visiting the area. The friendly and attentive staff, location, spacious rooms, and excellent facilities make it a good choice for accommodation."
"I must mention a minor issue that we encountered during our stay. One of the rooms we rented had a slight problem with humidity odor. While it wasn't overpowering, it was noticeable upon entering the room. As soon we turned the AC on it was gone. We didn't even try to change room for it and didn't notify the staff as it wasn't so strong. The offered AC and fan in each room."
The view was really amazing. The breakfast wasn't that great and not many options. Pool was clean
"The room pictures indicate the existence of bathtub, and this was one of our main reasons to book this villa. However, there was no water in the bathtub, and we could not use it at all! We were told by the hotel management that they are saving water etc. for whatever reasons they are not willing to provide the bathtub to the customer they must inform the customer before the booking has been made. In booking.com the room is advertised with the bathtub, and this is not acceptable."
"Everything was clean, super friendly staff, everything we needed was accessible"
Nothing at all
Loved the location amazing views and access to waterfall
Restaurant food and drinks prices were in usd and very very expensive for Bali
"The property is surrounded by beautiful natural landscapes with waterfall and river passing by.
And the staff is super helpful!"
The calmness that expresses and make you feel while you are by the pool overlooking the forest all around.
The room size was big and the staff was friendly.
"Poor Breakfast, I used to skip them all.
Was better to have it outside than inside, they should definitely reconsider their menu there."
"We liked the pools and generally the environment was stunning. Beautiful pools with the jungle views was what I expected from Bali.
Breakfast was okay, we could choose from 5 types of breakfast and it was delicious. Breakfast was served in a nice place with a view of the fish and garden. 
Music was relaxing.
Room was spacious and cleaners made our bed everyday.
Staff is extremely nice and respectful."
"We had cockroaches in our room which was disgusting. Asked to change the room but our request was denied as apparently all the rooms were full.
Horrible smell from the bathroom everyday. The pipes were stinking so badly, we wanted to vomit. The bathroom is not very well built so the water was not draining , bacteria was building in the bathroom and the smell was horrendous.
My partner requested washing his clothes, which was returned clean but he got an allergic reaction on his back from the washing liquid they used. How do we know this? He still had 2 T-shirts from home . He wore it and his back was okay. Then he wore a t-shirt cleaned by the resort and whole back was red with pimples.
The room was okay but we could hear the opening other people's rooms and it woke us up everyday so rooms are not soundproof at all. At some point I could hear a man vomiting in the middle of the night in the building."
"Beautiful place to staff, lovely scenery and access to river was amazing. Very lovely staff and excellent service."
Beautiful resort with very friendly staff
The view from the infinity pool and the artwork.
"My husband and I were booked to spend 3 nights here but only stayed one due to some issues that arose.
The cleanliness was very poor. I don't know if they rushed our room since we arrived before check in. Upon arrival they said our room would be ready in half hr. We were happy to leave our bags and wait for check in time but since they said it could be done soon, we decided to wait around. An hr later no one had notified us, so we went to the lobby. The main lobby clerk  jumped on the phone to find out if our room was ready. At this point we felt well looked after and the man who welcomed us was friendly.
Unfortunately, the toilet had a significant pool of vomit or poo (brown substance) splashed around it and tampon wrappers on the floor. It wasn't easily spotted since the floor is pink marble-like. Upon closer inspection, you could see rims left around the sink suggesting these areas had been missed. We actually decided to clean it and not let it ruin our stay. I honestly didn't feel all that trusting that the cleaners could do a good enough job and if I did it myself, at least I knew it was disinfected.
We booked this place because it seemed like a quiet retreat but it was far from it. The views from the infinity pool are beautiful and there's lots of lovely architecture. But we were kept awake by a very bright light coming in through a window above the doorway that had no curtain and could not be turned off. We were also awakened by a cockerel at 4am, which continued all through the morning. We left at 9:30am and it was still going. I totally get that this is part of the lifestyle in Bali, and perhaps this wouldn't have bothered us too much if it wasn't for the room description saying 'soundproofing' which was why we chose to stay here. We barely get any sleep being new parents, so we specifically looked for a room that promised quiet."
Location nice and the swimming pool had a nice view but online it looks more luxerious than in real life
Too many noises at night and also the price is too high for what you get. I wouldn't call it a resort.....
"The pool is great. Hostel is very well design, fancy! The bed is comfortable and rooms are very clean."
There was a renovation and pool area was noisy for that reason. The weekly events were getting cancelled due to low attendance. They could be organized better to gather more people together.
"Beautiful place with trees, forest, pools, rice fields, decorate with paintings and local art. Quiet, good place to relax. Friendly staffs"
Far from central Ubud.
The views from pool are were amazing and the waterfall on site was lovely. the pool was perfect and we saw monkeys most days! breakfast was amazing every day
"the bed could have been comfier, there were a lot of bugs but that is to be expected with the location. drinks in the restaurant were quite pricey too."
"Great setting
Quiet and peaceful
Great views from pool and breakfast location
Spacious room
Friendly and helpful staff
Clean
Surrounded by art all over the place"
"Less spectacular view from the studio room.
The pillows are very soft and flat."
"The whole property is amazing endeed! but it also needs a bit of attention. It looks a bit rusted sometimes and need a little renovation. 
Eventhough when the food was delicious, it was a bit expensive, specially considering you get change in USD Dollars. 
the service and the staff were very nice and helpful!
I would give it a second chance in the future."
It need some maintenance. The building itself is looking a bit rusted and old fashion. 
great swiming pool but also need some cleaning and some umbrelas.
"Nature, spiritual, ethnic, the river. It‚Äôs 20-30minutes away from the centre, which makes it the best place to be closest to nature. I think the hotel is a tour on its own. I was so happy with the room I got. It reminds me so much of Studio Ghibli‚Äôs Spirited Away. It has access to the river."
The art gallery tour cannot be done until a group will do it
Great remote location in the middle of rice fields and jungles. The resort is very green and spread out over quite a large area. The pool is lovely with a fantastic view.
"Rooms are located in a rather new ugly building with terrible acoustics! You can hear tv from rooms above and around you. Our first night we were woken up at 4am and then again at 5 by other people checking in and rattling with luggage, door handles, etc. Bathroom did not have any window or fan and you could smell the toilet pipes when showering for some reason. The aesthetics of the room left much to be desired especially given the beauty of both traditional and modern Balinese furniture everywhere else."
Location is very good if you want to roam around Ubud. Its beautiful and the staff is lovely. There is a waterfall in the resort which is very good. Food was amazing. Pools were good.
Bed could be bit more comfortable. But manageable for short stays
the swimming pool and the monkeys :)
"the breakfast was really dissatisfying, not so many choices"
"Beautiful and picturesque, great views from room."
"The staff did not allow us to look after our own room key and we were required to return it each time we left the building. They reported it was due to having to pay $150 aud to replace the lock should we loose the key‚Ä¶ which we tried to say that we would pay should be loose it as we would rather keep the key for peace of mind as we felt uncomfortable. At the end of the day, they did not allow us to keep the key with us. We had specifically asked for our room to not be cleaned and this request was not granted. The air conditioner in the room was poor and did not make a significant difference in temperature. Staff were friendly however, we felt as thought we were being watched each time we left the room in an eerie way. There was only one other guest staying in the resort during our stay and the resort felt abandoned and uncomfortable for two young girls. It was extremely difficult to get Gojeks from the hotel to get into town, so we hired our own scooter which ended up being the best option for the 15-20min ride into Ubud. The television was unable to connect to any decent Chanel‚Äôs."
"Nice gardens and pool , great quiet location"
"The shower needed at least 5-8minutes of continuous running to get the hot water through, the next morning I tried several times but the Hot water didn‚Äôt work at all . The lick in the door was old and worn out. We found someone else‚Äôs vape in the pocket of a supplied robe and has me wondering if the robe was even washed from the previous persons use."
"Very isolated, pools dirty, food average and expensive"
The views were great
They first tried to put us in a basic room but after complaining the photos looked very different they moved us to a nicer room. Weird vibe with the staff and owner. The old white guy who owns the place seems to have all his staff struck with fear. Breakfast got worse each day.
"I stayed in the ‚Äòpanoramic view villa‚Äô or Bali Villa 1, with my family. They accommodated the youngest child (14 y/o) free of charge - with breakfast and and extra bed!!"
"While it is true that some facilities are not fully updated, such as limited charging ports, what Tanah Merah lacks in the shiniest fittings it more than makes up for in its authentic Balinese charm and excellent customer service. In my opinion, if you want to truly experience Bali and still live in comfort and style, you are better off at Tanah Merah, than some clandestine hotel with its cookie cutter design. For one, the view is sublime and the location is right above petanu river and a beautiful waterfall you have direct access to. It is also a short drive from centre city ubud while still being a  private retreat. Secondly, the furnishings and design of the villa has been done with a keen eye for detail. We spent long nights in the open air area on a raised wooden platform with traditional seating, overlooking the rainforest. I can of course only speak of the villa we stayed in and the villas next to us. Breakfast perfectly suited our needs with a range of options to choose from, the staff were very friendly and accommodating to our vegetarian dietary needs. After breakfast in the morning we could find the owner Dr Peter in the lounging in the lobby, definitely take the opportunity to chat with him about the history of the resort- he built it himself and you can tell the effort and care he still puts in it based on the excellent management of the resort."
worst stay ever
"In regards to my stay in the hotel, it was one of the worst experiences have ever had. i got tricked by your advertisement that it is 5 star hotel while the property its just a hostel it doesnot deserve any star rating.
Starting from the checkin:
1) I arrived in the night as my flight with the evening there was only one guy at the property.(Security problem, plus nobody to help with the luggage) i had to carry(no trolley ofcourse!) myself 4 bags to the room and through the stairs to reach the so called villa.
2) poor illumination all around. my daughter tripped three times un even stairs!!.
3) No room service!!. i called the number put in their menu it was ringing with no one is picking the phone. i  called the reception and they gave me another number. they said we do not do room service because we are out of staff. thats not a kind of answer to receive form so called 5 star hotel.
4) the room condition-villa it was very poorly maintained. doors not closing properly the mesch installed aroud the opening is rusted and broken i have to close the opening by plastic bag myself.... the water pressure is very poor, all the windows do not close properly another security problem.
5) the breakfast was very poor it is similar to the quality of a hostage. one egg one coffee and old danish not even heated. coffee mostly water and no choices!!.
6) the pool is also poorly maintained during the stay i have never seen a pool guy cleaning the pool or spraying chlorine on it. again its health hazard.
7) whenever i am asking for taxi they are taking advatage of the tourist and charging more. infront of me the family was dropped from the airport and i wanted to go to ubud center they charged 80k IDR while it costs max of 50k IDR.
thats not professionalism from so called 5 star hotel.
i checked out earlier than expected as i couldnot stay in such property. when i asked to refund for last niht they refused as they say its not refundable.
as a respectable company Booking.com people use a"
The people were really nice and the resort was beautiful. Excellent customer service and a warm welcome and goodbye.
The rooms are clean. The pool area is the nicest spot!
"The rooms and decor is very dated. The kettle is placed in the bathroom which is terrible. the toilets don't flush paper, so just hoe you don't have Bali belly, coz that wipes goes in the bin. Not ideal for long stay."
"Tanah Merah Resort was absolutely beautiful place to stay. Gorgeous location, amazing staff, and awesome room."
Location is good. The staff is so helpful and smile. Endless pool is amazing!
"The room was dirty
Eggs (insect) on and next to the bed
The bedding was dirty and damp
The mattress had mildew on it
The food was disappointing
You had to leave your keys with them when you left the property
That‚Äôs why we left after our first night and didn‚Äôt stay the full 3. Would not recommend this place at all"
I liked the big room and comfy bed. I walked down to the river which was a workout
That it was advertised as heated pool. The bath looked lovely however it didn't work. The sky garden was shut as no staff althoogh there was plenty in the kitchen
What was portrayed on the website
"False advertising. Promoted as having 2 restaurants (one with view over ravine) and sky bar (with magnificent view. Only one restaurant open and no lovely view. This was peak season and resort apparently booked out. Art collection not freely available to view. Need to book tour and not avail every day. Our breakfast was inedible. 2 pools, one teeny and the other sample but both have no shade and no umbrellas. I could go on with more suffice to say they need to lift their game. I‚Äôm a frequent Bali visitor. I do not recommend this place."
The room itself was beautiful and the beds are really comfortable. The staff are really polite and accommodating.
"Many of the amenities weren‚Äôt open, even though they are mentioned in their welcome leaflet and booking confirmation. It would‚Äôve been nice if the bars were open as there wasn‚Äôt much of an atmosphere around the place. We felt the hotel needed a freshen up as it felt abit unloved. The restaurant on-site was extremely expensive for the quality of food (two chicken subs, two beers and two juices for around $50. This was one of our most expensive meals the whole trip!!!)."
It was so beautiful. The view of the jungle from my villa was superb. I definitely recommend booking a villa over a room as they didn‚Äôt seem nearly as nice. The staff were so helpful and friendly and not just out for your money like in some places I stayed. I absolutely adored the place and wish I‚Äôd been there longer. Definitely order the steak if go. It‚Äôs the best ever!
Nothing at all. It is a bit far out of town. But that‚Äôs what made it nice. Just stock up on drinks and snacks on your way. As there aren‚Äôt many shops nearby. My taxi driver was happy to stop at a supermarket on way.
"Studio room really generous size, pool beautiful, view beautiful, staff very welcoming, easy access to Ubud"
Hotel is a little 'tired' and lots of small things that could be done just that little bit better took the 'gloss' off our stay when compared to other Balinese hotels & villas. Like no drinking water in the rooms or asking for an extra piece of toast at breakfast and being told 'not sure that is possible'. Really simple things but just felt hotel wanted to charge for everything. 1 restaurant & rooftop bar not ope during our stay in high season. Nice place but to be honest can do better for the money
The pool area was nice.
"This place is super old and creepy. The building is full of moist and mold. The rooms are very dirty and not clean. Stay away from this place, it's been a real bad experience overall."
"Beautiful location, friendly staff, very clean rooms. Just pure Balinese hospitality."
The hygiene can be improved.
"The property and location was amazing. Good substantial breakfast with options, friendly staff and the owner provided a personal touch by sharing stories of his journey. We spent a whole day just exploring and enjoying the property and it's surroundings."
"the location, the staff, the facilities.. everything!"
nothing at all!
Fantastic pool and the view. If you get the real villa with garden view then you are happy.
We got cheated by the hotel. We booked two villas with garden view. Instead we got one villa and one simple apartment with an iron door and a view of a back of hotel. It was not even a nice forest view. Attaching few pics so that other customers know what they can possibly get when booking a villa. The hotel says they have two interior pictures added to the villa gallery so everything is fair. But they have not showed the outside because nobody would ever choose this for villa with garden view.
The Resort is amazing and we enjoyed our stay there. But you will only enjoy it if you like the history. The Resort is a living museum with art. We felt like we were living inside an art museum.
The resort needs a little bit of maintenance. The food was okay in some dishes and amazing in others.
"Very comfortable
Better in reality"
"Good location, great view and a waterfall and river nearby. The hotel and the room were well decorated with pieces of art. The hotel staff were helpful. The view in the infinity pool was amazing."
The breakfast was not that good and can be improved
"Friendly staff
The Balinese environment"
To far away from anything $10 taxi to ubud
Over 2hrs from airport
No restaurants close so had to eat their or go to ubud.Cost"
"It‚Äôs old and in need of maintenance , paint peeling , a bath without any taps , the art it‚Äôs suppose to be about was mostly locked rooms you couldn‚Äôt go into , the free breakfast was , well you would not pay for it"
Awesome location and beautiful gardens .so peaceful and quiet .it was like we were the only people there and the river and jungle views are epic .close to lots of attractions as well
Lots of stairs to negotiate if you are on the lower levels but not a deal breaker
"Ambience, service, location"
"We LOVED our stay at Tanah Merah. The pool is stunning, our room was lovely, everywhere is well maintained and clean. The staff are so polite and helpful. It's a little further from Ubud than we realised but that was actually a good thing, it's tucked away from all of the chaos and noise. You can fall asleep to the sounds of the jungle. Incredible. We would highly recommend staying here!!"
"Nothing, it was perfect."
"Exceptional wonderful friendly staff. NGURAH is a gem! Maybe you will be lucky enough for him to greet you. Hotel is the amalgamation of a lovely Danish man's life work, collecting art and creating a very special location close to Ubud but far from the madding crowds. The views from the infinity pools are Four Seasons Standard.....simply astonishing. The rooms are cavernous and the bathtub made me feel like a prince. Can't fault this extraordinary resort!"
Absolutely nothing to complain about.
"The property was alright. The staff was the best part about the property. The property manager was very helpful and everyone else was very pleasant. Despite only eating at the restaurant at the hotel and drinking the water from the hotel, my mom still got ‚ÄòBali Belly‚Äô and the property manager was very responsive and arranged to have a doctor come to the hotel within an hour.
The owner has a gallery of his artifacts that he‚Äôs collected over the years and it‚Äôs quite impressive. The location is quite far from everything. A lot of tour groups that offer pickup from Ubud would not pick up from the hotel and if they did, they would for an extra fee. The hotel offered their own tours but it was considerably more expensive."
"There are 2 restaurants at the property; however, due to the pandemic, they only operate one but have both menus available. The one menu is charged in USD, and is quite expensive. In addition to the expensive prices, there‚Äôs a 21% tax and service charge added. We required laundry services during our stay and despite the fees being advertised in rupiah, we were charged in USD, the conversion at the time of check out was not equivalent to the rupiah advertised. The showers have no water pressure at all. The wifi is very slow. There was also no complimentary shuttle to Ubud centre available (despite the hotel advertising that it has this service)."
A fantastic treasure in the most wonderful location. Outstanding customer care and service.
the food and the staff in the sky bar
"layout, garish yellow paint, pools were not clean"
"simple food , not too bad."
"they gave me the wrong room which is much cheaper than I booked , and refused to compensate the room rate difference."
"Every meal was wonderful, menu includes traditional Indonesian food as well as Western options.
The entire resort is extremely clean and well maintained. 
There are have 2 pools, and a private track down to two waterfalls!
There's an enormous art gallery on site.
Rooftop bar with views of jungle, rice paddies and volcanoes! 
There's even a driver to take you into Ubud whenever you'd like
The staff is a collection of the nicest people in Bali"
"unique one-of a kind resort with excellent view, great staff and an amazing art museum. the host was just superb with such a vast knowledge of Bali to share."
Restaurant viel een beetje tegen maar het eten was wel lekker.
"The hotel is in a very quiet area away from Ubud traffic, The view from the sky bar inside the hotel was phenomenal!. The staff was really nice and professional me and my wife enjoyed so much everything about thing about place its very instagramable for those who wonders we would recommend it for everyone 10/10"
Booked this hotel for the art and the 5 star rating. Only the art lived up to my expectations.
"We were the only guest at the hotel. Rented a villa with pool and couldn‚Äôt swim in the pool with all the live bugs. Pool was not chlorinated and the stream of water was too weak to deter mosquitoes. In the middle of the jungle, the owner had the nerve to say there were no mosquitoes or other bugs around."
"old decoration
uncomfortable beds and pillows
cant keep key when leaving
old facilities
dirty swimming pool
noisy bugs during night
dirty place"
Room was big and property was pretty
Why was all food drinks in dollars and almost triple the price
"Superb location, the gardens are so well designed, 2 pools. Art work everywhere and a superb museum/gallery to lose yourself in."
nice styling but very much dated
"wasn‚Äôt clean at all, staff in the restaurant pretty lazy and at several occasions the ordered food wasn‚Äôt available"
worst hotel ive ever stayed in
doesn‚Äôt look like pictures at all
"Frankly, I liked everything, this place is magical."
Food was not the best.
"Breakfast was fulfilling, 
Location and ambiance perfect.
A beautiful retreat."
Everything was perfect.
The only good think was the staff. They are super nice and helpful.
Everything except the staff
"Great location, excellent room with private pool, and amazing restaurant onsite. Lots of interesting art exhibitions on the area. Superb staff and management."
Good place
Not clean hotel.you cant guess how many people sleep your pillow they are not clean. Everything is broken and duvet was three piece and you dont sleep in it it sleep in you.it was not a comfortable rooom
"The room wasn't clean, Facilities not good- personal soaps etc in bathroom were not good.
Bed very small for the size of the room."
view was amazing. staff were friendly and helpful. spacious room. Location was 15 min drive from Ubud center.
Bathroom was dirty when we arrived. there was dust everywhere. toilet seat was dirty and we had to wipe it with wipes. breakfast had limited options. One day they were out of bread.
Amazing resort for art lovers and to see Bali from the mountain perspective!  Friendly owner and staff.  Great breakfast included in our stay.
The room needs a good reading area and light for evenings.
The staff were lovely
It was the most expensive place I've stayed while travelling and probably the most uncomfortable.
